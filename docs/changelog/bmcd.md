# bmcd

The daemon: the API, the update logic, the metrics.

Newest release **2.36.3**, 12 September 2026. 38 in total. Each entry is this repository's own [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/excavador-turing/bmcd/blob/hive/CHANGELOG.md) where it has one, and the release note where it does not — fetched by `just refresh-changelog`, so this page and the repository cannot disagree.

???+ note "2.36.3 — 12 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`/metrics` now reports the USB multiplexer, including which module is
      armed for USB boot.** Two families: `bmcd_node_usb_boot_armed`, one sample
      per module, and `bmcd_usb_config`, which names the node, mode, route and bus
      type of the persisted configuration.

      `tpi flash` and `tpi advanced msd` leave the configuration at
      `Flashing(NodeN, …)`. The daemon persists that and re-applies it on every
      start, which asserts that module's USB-boot pin and stops it booting from
      its own eMMC. The module keeps running, because it is already booted — so
      the fault appears at its **next** reboot, possibly weeks later, and then it
      comes up in the USB loader instead of its operating system.

      From outside, that module is indistinguishable from dead hardware: nothing
      at all on the serial console, not even a bootloader banner, because the
      loader does not use the console; nothing on the network; and the BMC
      reporting its rail on. `tpi usb status` could not separate the two either,
      because it prints the same route for `UsbA` and `Flashing`. The only readout
      that named the mode was a line in the daemon's own log.

      Measured on hive-6, 2026-09-12: twenty minutes spent on a module that looked
      dead, with the fact that explained it sitting unexported in the daemon's
      database. `bmcd_node_usb_boot_armed{node="node2"} 1` would have answered it
      in one query, and a rule on fifteen minutes of it pages the operator who
      armed it while they still remember doing so.

      The armed family is four samples rather than one because a single
      "which node" gauge cannot express *none*, and none is the normal state it
      exists to assert.

    **Changed**

    - `UsbConfig::parts()` is now the single mapping from a stored configuration
      to `(node, mode, route)`. The `type=usb` response and the metrics exposition
      share it, so a board cannot report one thing through the API and another on
      a dashboard.

??? note "2.36.2 — 12 September 2026 (no release of its own)"

    **Fixed**

    - **The board refused every attempt to resume a TLS session, fatally.** This
      is the intermittent fleet console failure: a serial console or an API call
      through the gateway would occasionally fail outright, on both boards,
      with nothing in the daemon's log and the board perfectly healthy either
      side of it.

      Envoy keeps one TLS session per upstream cluster and offers it on the next
      connection it opens. Measured on the gateway, a third of all new upstream
      connections to the two boards died this way — 8 of 28 to one, 19 of 45 to
      the other — while every connection taken from the pool was fine, which is
      what made it look random from a browser. Reproduced deterministically from
      a pod on the gateway's own node: 30 fresh connections all succeeded, and 30
      that offered back a saved session all failed with `tlsv1 alert internal
      error`.

      OpenSSL will not resume a session on a server that asks for client
      certificates unless the context carries a session id context, and the
      refusal is not a quiet cache miss — it is `internal_error`, fatal, sent
      before a byte of HTTP is exchanged. The error, `ssl_get_prev_session:
      session id context uninitialized`, is raised on the server, which never
      logged it; the client sees only an alert it cannot explain.

      So the fault arrived with client certificates in 2.30.0 and was invisible
      from the daemon's side for six releases.

      The acceptor now sets a session id context, derived from the client CA so
      that a board whose trust anchor is replaced will not resume a session
      authenticated under the old one. There is a test that performs two real
      handshakes against the real acceptor and offers the first session back; it
      fails on 2.36.1 with the OpenSSL error above.

??? note "2.36.1 — 12 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **Every refusal from the new access endpoints answered 500.** Measured on
      bmc-2 within the hour of flashing v2.28.0: "the current password is wrong"
      and "the new password is too short" both came back `500 Internal Server
      Error`, which tells a client the board is broken rather than that the
      request was — and 500 is the canonical retryable status, so a client is
      being invited to retry an answer that will never change.

      `impl ResponseError for LegacyResponse {}` was empty, so actix's default
      status applied to everything. That was invisible until now because handlers
      reached through the legacy dispatcher come back as a `LegacyResponse`
      rendered by `Responder`, which has always honoured the carried status;
      `api::access` is the first to return one as an `Err` directly to actix.

      It now reports the status it was built with and renders through the same
      conversion the success path uses, so a refusal has one shape wherever it
      came from. The guards themselves were correct throughout — the right
      requests were refused with the right messages, with the wrong number on
      them.

??? note "2.36.0 — 12 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **Who may reach this board, from the interface that asks for the password**
      (SQU-209). Both halves of this board's access control used to live only on
      its filesystem and arrive over SSH: the local password through `passwd` on a
      console, the client CA through a script in another repository. Nothing in
      the web interface could answer "who can get in", and the one interface that
      demands a password every time could not change it.

      `GET /api/bmc/access` now answers with the local account, the trust anchor
      for proxied identity if one is in effect — subject, issuer, expiry and a
      SHA-256 fingerprint to compare against the proxy's — the header an identity
      is read from and which of config/override/default chose it, and **how the
      asking request was itself authenticated**. A page can now say "you are here
      as oleg@tsarev.id, vouched for by the gateway" rather than guess.

      `POST /api/bmc/access/password` changes a local password, and
      `PUT`/`DELETE /api/bmc/access/client-ca` set and remove the trust anchor.

      **Not through the legacy dispatcher, and that is the point.** Every
      `opt=set` call is written to the audit log with its whole query string, so a
      password routed that way would be recorded in clear in `bmcd.<date>.log` and
      in remote syslog when SQU-108 lands. These take a JSON body and log the
      action and the actor, never the secret.

      The rules each exist because of a specific way this could go wrong:

      - **The current password is required, including from an operator a proxy
        vouched for.** A certificate proves the gateway trusts you; it does not
        prove you hold this board's console, and a change made without the old
        password is a lockout anyone with a live session can perform.
      - **Twelve characters, counted as characters.** A passphrase is not shorter
        because it is written in Cyrillic, and `BanPatrol` slows an online guess
        but does nothing for a stolen `/etc/shadow`.
      - **A wrong password and an account that does not exist get the same
        refusal**, so this cannot be used to enumerate accounts.
      - **`chpasswd`, with the pair on stdin.** Not a shell and not a command
        line: this daemon runs as root, and a password in `argv` is in `ps` for
        anyone on the box.
      - **A CA bundle is loaded the way the TLS acceptor will load it, before it
        is stored.** A bundle that cannot be loaded makes the daemon fail to
        *start* — which is exactly why `client_ca` was never safe to ship in a
        default `config.yaml` — so it must never reach the disk.
      - **Removing the CA is refused when the caller is authenticated by it.**
        That request ends its own session, through the proxy it is asking
        through. Do it from the board's own interface, with a password.

      **The daemon does not rewrite `config.yaml`.** That file is the operator's,
      it carries comments, and the daemon reads it with a crate that has no
      writer. So the interface owns two small files instead — the bundle itself at
      a fixed path, and a JSON sidecar for the header name — and `config.yaml`
      still wins wherever it speaks. Where it pinned a value, these endpoints
      refuse to touch it and say so.

      A consequence worth having: `client_ca` now falls back to that fixed path
      **when the file exists**, so a board whose anchor was removed comes back up
      instead of refusing to start.

??? note "2.35.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **The board could stop checking for firmware, for ever** (SQU-201). The
      Firmware page said *checking the sources now* and never stopped, with
      **Check now** disabled beside it, and no later refresh could start. Only
      restarting the daemon cleared it. Opening the Firmware tab on a board whose
      cached listing had aged out was enough to trigger it; bmc-2 sat that way for
      three and a half hours on 2026-09-11 with `refreshing: true`, the timestamp
      frozen, and no fan-out process running at all.

      The claim that says "a refresh is running" was an `AtomicBool`, taken before
      the work and released by a `Drop` guard. That is correct for a panic and
      wrong for everything else: a task dropped before its first poll constructs
      no guard, and a blocking join that never returns never drops one.

      It is a deadline now, and a deadline cannot be lost — the claim expires
      whether or not anything is left to release it. Three things release it and
      it takes all three: the guard for a panic, a `tokio::time::timeout` around
      the fan-out for a blocking join that never returns, and the deadline for the
      case where neither of the other two exists. The dedup that stops "check now"
      turning four sources into twelve requests is kept as a compare-exchange.

      The bound is ten minutes. Not a guess at the work: the fan-out was 74–78 s
      when first measured, and on 2026-09-12 took 75–100 s on bmc-1 and about
      230 s on bmc-2. It is how long a *lost* refresh may block every future one.

    **Added**

    - **The firmware listing survives a reboot**, at
      `/mnt/overlay/firmware-catalog.json`. Asking four sources takes between 75
      and 230 seconds and spends GitHub's unauthenticated quota of sixty an hour
      four at a time, and all of it used to be thrown away by every reboot — so
      the first person to open the Firmware page after an upgrade, the person most
      likely to be looking, paid for the lot.

      It sits beside `firmware-sources.json` and on the overlay for the same
      reason: both firmware images mount it, so it survives an A/B promotion. The
      board answers from it at once and refreshes behind that answer. The age it
      reports comes from the timestamp inside the file rather than the file's
      mtime, because what a reader needs is when the *sources* were asked, and an
      age that parses to something absurd is clamped to a day.

      **It is written only when the offering changes.** The overlay is NAND and
      UBI reports five free eraseblocks of 2040 on the reference board; a listing
      rewritten every half hour would be thousands of writes a year for bytes that
      change when somebody publishes a release. The comparison is on what the
      sources offer, not the whole record, because the timestamp moves every time.

      Only a complete answer is stored: a fan-out where one source errored is good
      enough to show, because the page renders the error, and not good enough to
      become the listing a board boots with.

??? note "2.34.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`opt=get&type=sdcard_files`, also `GET /api/bmc/sdcard/files`: what is on
      the microSD card** (SQU-198). Name, size, modified time, and whether each
      entry could be written to a compute module.

      `tpi flash --local` already reads an image off this card, and it is the only
      sane way to write a multi-gigabyte image to a module: the browser is not in
      the path, the bytes do not cross the network twice, and an interrupted
      upload does not mean starting over. What was missing was any way to see what
      is there — so an operator had to know the path and type it, for the most
      destructive thing this board does.

      A non-candidate is **listed, not hidden**, with the reason: a 10-byte
      `.img` says it is most likely a truncated download, and a `.tpu` says it is
      BMC firmware and belongs on the firmware page. Hiding them makes an operator
      who cannot find the file they just copied conclude the page is broken.

      The verdict is from the name and the size only. Nothing opens a file:
      deciding by content means reading the head of every entry on every listing,
      and what actually protects a flash is the checksum the operator compares.

    **Security**

    - **Every path is confined to the card, in one function with its own tests.**
      A listing that accepts `../..` is a directory browser rooted at `/` on a
      device that can reflash four computers — and the same resolver will serve
      rename and delete later, so it is worth getting right once.

      The root and the target are both canonicalised and compared, so `a/../../etc`
      and a **symlink** pointing off the card are caught by the same rule rather
      than by a check written against the text of the request. A leading `/` is
      stripped rather than honoured. A path that does not exist answers "not
      found", never "outside", because saying "outside" for a typo tells a client
      something about the filesystem it did not earn.

??? note "2.33.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **A node's USB bus number is not part of its identity, and pinning it
      refused every flash.** The port check added to stop a flash of node 2
      writing node 1 compared the whole path — bus included — against a bus
      hardcoded to 1. It is not a constant. This board pairs an OHCI and an EHCI
      controller as companions for the same physical ports, so the bus a device
      lands on is decided by its **speed**: the same hub port is `1-1.2` for a
      full-speed device and `2-1.2` for a high-speed one.

      A Rockchip in maskrom is high-speed. So every RK1 the daemon was asked to
      flash or expose as mass storage was refused with

      ```
      node 2 requested on 1-1.2; found Rockusb on 2-1.2 instead
      ```

      about a module that was entirely healthy. Found on bmc-2 on 2026-09-11 while
      trying to recover a node that would not boot.

      The comparison is now on the port chain alone, which is the part that says
      which module this is. Anything downstream that has to match a sysfs path —
      finding the block device behind a module — is handed the path of the device
      that actually answered, so it carries the bus the kernel really used rather
      than a guess.

      Two tests pin it: the same hub port resolves to the same node on either bus,
      and no two nodes share a port chain once the bus is out of the comparison.

??? note "2.32.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`/metrics` reports when the certificate the listener is serving expires**,
      as `bmcd_tls_certificate_expiry_timestamp_seconds`, alongside
      `bmcd_tls_certificate_info{key="ecdsa-p384"}` naming the key it is built on.

      This exists because of SQU-115: a board served a certificate that had
      expired more than a year earlier and nothing anywhere said so. A number a
      scrape can alert on is the difference between that and a calendar reminder
      somebody stops reading. The key label is the first thing anyone reaches for
      when a client refuses to negotiate.

      Both are read from the certificate the daemon actually loaded, at start, so
      `/metrics` cannot disagree with the listener about which certificate is in
      use — replacing the file without restarting is exactly when a fresh read
      would describe something that is not being served.

      A daemon that cannot make sense of the date reports **no series at all**
      rather than a zero, because a zero reads as 1970 and would fire every
      expiry rule ever written against it.

      Nothing here is secret: every byte of it is sent to each client during the
      handshake.

    ##### Confirmed

    - **Every key an operator might install is served**, over TLS 1.3 and 1.2
      alike: RSA, EC P-256, P-384 and P-521, and Ed25519. This was already true
      and is now a test that performs a real handshake per key type against the
      real acceptor, so it covers the cipher list and the signature algorithms
      rather than only PEM parsing. The estate rule is P-384, cert-manager will
      mint Ed25519 on request, and a certificate from a public CA is usually
      still RSA — a daemon quietly serving only some of those fails at renewal
      time, which is the worst moment to find out.

??? note "2.31.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - **The daemon offers TLS 1.3, with 1.2 as the fallback.** The acceptor was
      built from Mozilla's version 4 intermediate profile, which pins the maximum
      protocol version to TLS 1.2; the board's OpenSSL is 3.5.7 and was capable of
      1.3 all along. The v5 profile is 1.2 and 1.3 together, so no client loses
      anything.

      This is not a modernisation. A TLS-1.2-only server changes what a client has
      to send: under 1.2 the client's `supported_groups` extension constrains the
      curve of the SERVER's certificate as well as the key exchange (RFC 4492
      §5.1). A client whose curve list stops at P-256 — which is Envoy's default —
      cannot use a P-384 certificate and gets `handshake_failure`. Every
      certificate in the estate this daemon runs in is P-384.

      What that looked like: a proxy holding a valid client certificate, failing
      every handshake, while the page in front of it drew perfectly and every board
      card said the board did not answer. The only trace was the proxy's own
      `ssl.connection_error` counter.

      Two tests cover it, and both were confirmed to fail without the change:
      `the_acceptor_offers_tls13_and_still_falls_back_to_tls12`, and
      `a_client_with_envoys_default_curves_can_reach_a_p384_certificate`, which
      also asserts that the same client pinned to TLS 1.2 still cannot get in — so
      the test cannot quietly stop proving anything.

??? note "2.30.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **A proxy holding a certificate from a trusted CA can name the human it
      authenticated.** `tls.client_ca` turns it on; absent, which is what a board
      ships with, nothing changes and the header below is never read. This is the
      daemon half of SQU-136 and the reason a fleet interface can be exposed while
      a board cannot.
    - `tls.identity_header`, default `x-forwarded-email`: which header names that
      human. Believed **only** on a connection that presented a certificate this
      daemon verified. Without one it is ordinary attacker-controlled input —
      anybody on the management LAN can set a header — so the certificate is what
      makes it mean anything, and the two are useless apart.

    ##### Notes

    - A certificate authorises nothing by itself. It only makes the header worth
      reading; a trusted proxy that names nobody falls through to ordinary token
      authentication, and a blank name is treated as a misconfiguration rather
      than an anonymous login.
    - Client certificates are requested but not required, so a browser on the
      management LAN still reaches the login page. That is the break-glass path
      and it is deliberately untouched.
    - Audited as `<user> (mtls)`, so a fleet-initiated action names the operator
      rather than the proxy.

??? note "2.29.0 — 10 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`bmcd_firmware_last_promotion_timestamp_seconds`** (SQU-141). The counter
      beside it says how often the health gate reached a verdict; this says when
      the last one was, which is what an alert on "no promotion since" and a
      Grafana annotation beside a memory graph both need. The ticket asked for
      both families and only the counter had shipped.

      **It is absent rather than wrong when it cannot be trusted.** The gate writes
      whatever busybox `date` printed, and that is the board's own clock — a BMC
      that has just come up may not have reached chrony, so the instant can be well
      before the real one. The HELP text says so. And only `UTC` is accepted:
      chrono parses `%Z` as a token and cannot apply an offset, so reading any
      other zone as UTC would publish an instant that is confidently wrong and
      looks perfectly healthy. A missing gauge is a nuisance; a plausible wrong one
      is a trap.

      Three tests. One pins the exact format the gate produces, since parsing it is
      the whole feature. One refuses a non-UTC zone. One keeps garbage absent
      rather than letting it become a 1970 timestamp that reads as a real event.

    **Changed**

    - The fan-out doc comment said 16 s; measured twice on the board on 2026-09-09
      at **74 s and 78 s**, and once at 140 s the following day. Both figures are
      now recorded with which one no longer holds. It is not cosmetic: `tpi` 1.5.0
      was written believing a re-poll was quick.

??? note "2.28.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **Every read operation now describes what it answers with** (SQU-177). Ten
      handlers built their response with `json!` from several sources, so there
      was no type to derive a schema from and the document said only "not
      described here". `UNTYPED` is now empty.

      The shapes are **reconstructions, not designs**: every field is what the
      handler already sent, under the name it already used. A rename would break
      `tpi` and the web interface for no gain. Where a shape is odd the oddity is
      preserved and explained — `power`, `usb` and `sdcard` answer a one-element
      array, which is upstream's convention, and the document says so rather than
      claiming an object a client cannot index.

      Two details worth having in writing. `sdcard`'s used-bytes field is `use` on
      the wire, because that is what upstream sent, and `use` is a Rust keyword —
      so the field is renamed, and a test asserts the wire name rather than the
      Rust one. And `power` reports strings, not booleans, because a rail the
      daemon cannot read is `"Unknown"`; a boolean schema would generate a client
      that cannot represent the third case.

      Four new contract tests, in the style of the six from 2.25.0. Proven by
      removing the `use` rename: the fixture fails saying it no longer exercises
      what it was written for.

    **Fixed**

    - **A caller's mistake answers 400, not 500** (was SQU-176). Naming a cooling
      device that does not exist, or a step above the fan's maximum, is a client
      error, and the board answered as though it had failed.

      It matters because `problem+json` exists so a generated client can branch on
      `status`, and 500 is the canonical retryable one — so a client told 500 for
      "that device does not exist" retries forever against an answer that cannot
      change.

      Decided by downcasting a typed `CoolingRequestError`, not by matching on the
      message: the message is for a person and would take the status with it the
      first time somebody reworded it. The handlers wrap with `.context(...)`, so
      the check is against the root cause, and there is a test for exactly that.

    **Changed**

    - `schemars` derives reach eleven more types. The release binary is
      **13,024,808 bytes**, up from 12,938,240 measured at 2.26.0 — about 86 KB
      across both this release and 2.27.0's removals, which were not measured
      separately. A quarter of a percent of the rootfs.

??? note "2.27.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - **`/metrics` moved to its own listener: port 9110, plain HTTP, no
      credential** (SQU-178). It used to sit on `:443` beside the API and the web
      interface, behind TLS and a token of its own.

      The token existed for one reason — so that a credential in a scrape config
      could not also reach `/api/bmc` and power four compute modules off. On a
      listener that serves nothing but `/metrics` there is nothing else to reach.
      The property is kept and the mechanism is a port instead of a secret, which
      is one fewer thing to mint, store, rotate and leak.

      The TLS was always scraped with verification disabled, because the board's
      certificate is expired and carries no SAN, so nothing could verify it.
      Unverified TLS is a handshake per scrape on a Cortex-A7 in exchange for
      nothing. What protects the endpoint is the network, and the listener binds
      the same `host` as the API, so restricting the daemon to a management
      address restricts both.

      `metrics_port` is a new key in `default_config.yaml`, defaulted so that a
      configuration file written for an older bmcd still parses. A request to
      `/metrics` on `:443` now answers 404.

    **Removed**

    - **The metrics token, entirely.** `GET /api/bmc/metrics-token`,
      `POST /api/bmc/metrics-token/rotate`, the `metrics_token` operation, the
      bearer check on `/metrics`, and `/mnt/overlay/metrics-token`. Removed rather
      than left dormant: an endpoint that still exists is an endpoint someone will
      use.

    - **The config export's `secrets` tier.** The metrics token was the only thing
      in it, so `secrets`, `contains_secrets` and the `secrets=1` parameter all
      described a credential that no longer exists. An empty `secrets=1` would be
      a control that lies.

      `format_version` is unchanged at 1 on purpose: an export written by an older
      board still imports, because serde ignores the `secrets` and
      `contains_secrets` it carries. A test asserts that. The token inside it is
      dropped, which is the right fate for a credential nothing takes.

    ##### Side effect worth recording

    The promotion gate no longer depends on the `/api/bmc` loopback bypass. It
    used to reach through it to mint itself a token; it now makes one plain
    request to 9110. The on-board `tpi` is the only remaining user of the bypass
    (SQU-165).

??? note "2.26.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`bmcd --openapi` prints the API document and exits** (SQU-149, towards
      step 4). It needs neither a config file nor a board, which is the point:
      the docs site has to render this spec, and until now the only place it
      existed was a running BMC. That is a chicken-and-egg problem for anybody
      deciding whether to install a release.

    - **The release publishes `openapi.json`**, emitted by the binary that
      implements it and checksummed beside the source tarball. Emitted rather than
      committed, so it cannot describe a version that is not the one being
      released.

      The step refuses a document with fewer than twenty paths or five schemas. A
      generator that quietly fails produces a valid-looking file, and a
      valid-looking file is what would get published. Checked both ways before
      shipping: the real run reports `28 paths, 24 schemas` and exits 0; a stubbed
      empty document exits 1 saying so.

??? note "2.25.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **The published schemas are now checked against what the daemon actually
      sends** (SQU-149, step 3). A schema is derived from a type and a response is
      serialised from the same type, so the two agree only as far as `schemars`
      and `serde` agree — and they part company over exactly the attributes this
      daemon uses: `skip_serializing_if`, `rename_all`, and serde `default`s.
      Where they part, the document describes a shape the board never sends, which
      is what `tpi`'s three dead formatters were made of.

      Six tests build what a board would send and hold it against what the
      document promises. Proven by making the two disagree on purpose: adding
      `#[schemars(rename_all = "PascalCase")]` beside `PortKind`'s
      `#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]` fails both switch-port tests, naming the
      schema. Removing it returns 13 passed.

      The cases chosen are the ones with something to get wrong: a board with no
      promotion log, where `promotion_history` is omitted entirely rather than sent
      as null; the same board mid-update with every field present; a switch port
      whose `kind` is a renamed enum; a port the driver never probed, with every
      optional absent at once; and a fan both held and governed.

      `jsonschema` is a **dev-dependency**, so none of this reaches the board.

    **Fixed**

    - Nothing was wrong: `schemars` handles `skip_serializing_if` and
      `rename_all` correctly today. These tests record that and stop it drifting,
      which is a different and smaller claim than fixing something.

??? note "2.24.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **The OpenAPI document now describes what seven operations answer with**
      (SQU-149, step 2). `/thermal`, `/health`, `/cooling`, `/network`,
      `/firmware/slots`, `/firmware/sources` and `/firmware/check` carry real
      response schemas instead of `{}`.

      The schemas are **derived from the very types the handlers serialise**, not
      written out beside them. The failure this exists to stop is a client written
      against a shape the daemon has never sent — `tpi` shipped three such
      formatters, and nobody noticed because a fourth bug stopped any of them
      running. A hand-written schema is that same failure with an extra step
      between it and the reader.

    - **The operations that describe nothing are listed, not merely absent.**
      Eleven handlers assemble their answer with `json!` from several sources and
      have no single type to derive from. They are named in `UNTYPED`, their `200`
      says so in words, and a test requires every read operation to be either
      described or on that list. Proven by removing `/hostname` from it: the test
      fails naming exactly that path.

      Two more tests hold the rest together: nothing may be both described and
      declared undescribed, and every `$ref` in the document must resolve to a
      component that exists. A dangling `$ref` renders as an empty box in every
      viewer and generates a client that will not compile.

    **Changed**

    - `schemars` is a new dependency, and it costs **186 KB** of release binary,
      measured rather than assumed: 12,747,768 bytes before, 12,938,240 after.
      About half a percent of the rootfs, against a CI gate at ninety.

      A first measurement said it was free, which was wrong: with nothing calling
      the derived impls the linker had stripped them all. The number above is from
      a build where the document actually references them.

??? note "2.23.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **One audit line per mutating API call** (SQU-108). Until now a `power off`
      from the web interface, from `tpi` on the board and from a token over the
      network all looked the same in the log, because none of them was recorded
      with an identity. Each now writes a line on an `audit` target naming the
      action, the node, the caller, their address and the outcome.

      Written around the dispatcher rather than in each handler, for the same
      reason the dispatcher exists: there is one table of operations and two
      spellings of it, so an endpoint added later cannot quietly miss the line.
      Reads are not logged — they are most of the traffic and none of the risk.

    - **The loopback bypass is named in that line.** `/api/bmc` skips
      authentication entirely for requests from the board itself; the line for one
      says `loopback (unauthenticated)` rather than folding it in with a real
      credential. It is the entry somebody reading an audit trail would most want
      to be able to find, and it is the fault this fork already documents.

    - **Audit lines go to the system log as well as the rotating file.** Both
      `/tmp` and `/var/log` are tmpfs on this board, so a line that reaches only
      the file is gone at the next boot — which is exactly the event one would be
      trying to account for. They are sent to `/dev/log` as `authpriv.info`; a
      board with no syslogd keeps the file copy and says so once on startup.

      Verified against the board's own BusyBox syslogd, which renders the datagram
      as `Sep  9 14:57:06 hive-bmc authpriv.info bmcd[4242]: …`.

    **Changed**

    - **A bearer token now remembers who it was issued to.** The token store held
      only a last-access time, so a request authenticated by a token could not
      name its user — every audit line for every logged-in operator would have
      read the same. A unit test requires the username to come back from
      authorisation rather than merely `Ok`.

??? note "2.22.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **A flash now targets the module that was asked for** (SQU-105). On a v2.5
      board all four modules sit behind one GL850 hub, so every module in maskrom
      enumerates at once — and `find_first` returned whichever answered first,
      ignoring the requested node. Its comment still said "only one node can be
      visible at any given time", which was true of v2.4's single mux. The result
      was a flash of node 2 that wrote node 1 and reported success, or
      "Several supported devices found" on a routine two-module bench.

      A device is now accepted only on the hub port that node is wired to. A
      device on any other port is refused, naming both: *"node 3 requested on
      1-1.3; found Rockusb on 1-1.1 instead"*. The whole failure mode was a
      success message, so the replacement had to be an error that says what it
      found.

      The same rule applies to the mass-storage side: `get_device_path` used to
      demand exactly one Rockchip block device on the entire board and give up
      otherwise. It now filters by port, so two modules in maskrom stop being an
      ambiguity to report and become two ports to tell apart.

    - **The node-to-port mapping is read from the device tree, not assumed.** The
      v2.5 DTS declares `hub@1` with `node1@1` through `node4@4`, and the kernel
      publishes all of it under `/proc/device-tree`. Node N is port N on this
      board; hard-coding that would have been correct and would still have been a
      guess, and a wrong guess here writes the wrong module — which is the harm
      being fixed. A unit test builds a tree wired in the opposite order and
      requires the opposite answer.

      A board that describes no such hub — v2.4, one node visible at a time —
      yields no topology, and the first-match behaviour is kept unchanged. The
      device tree is therefore also the board-revision test, which is better than
      a revision string because it is the fact the kernel itself is acting on.

??? note "2.21.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **A fan can now be held at a step** (SQU-170). `opt=set&type=cooling` takes a
      new optional `mode`: `manual` pauses the zone's governor and then writes the
      step, `auto` hands the fan back. Omitted, the request means exactly what it
      always did — write the step and leave the governor running — so a client
      written before this keeps its behaviour.

      Until now `set_cooling_speed` wrote `cur_state` into a zone whose policy is
      `step_wise`, and the governor returned the fan to the trip the board was
      above within a poll. The write succeeded and the setting did not survive,
      which is the defect behind the fan slider that springs back.

      The governor is paused *before* the step is written. A `step_wise` poll is
      short enough to land between two writes done the other way round, which
      would leave the governor off on a step nobody asked for. If the step then
      fails to write, the governor is handed back rather than left paused.

    - **`type=cooling` reports `zone` and `overridden`**, so a client can tell
      whether a step it writes will hold instead of leaving a person to watch a
      slider and guess. `zone` is read from the zone's own `cdevN` symlinks rather
      than assumed: the kernel records the binding on the zone's side only, and
      `thermal_zone0` driving `cooling_device0` is true of this board, not of the
      interface.

    - **`bmcd_cooling_overridden`**, 1 while a fan is held. A hold that outlives
      the person who set it is the failure mode worth alerting on.

    **Changed**

    - **A held fan is taken back above the zone's hottest `active` trip**, checked
      every 15 seconds. This board declares no `critical` trip — the hottest thing
      in its device tree is `hot` at 95 °C, which notifies and does not act — so
      nothing else would intervene if a fan were left on a low step while the board
      climbed. Somebody who paused the governor and walked away is not expressing a
      preference about 80 °C.

      The ceiling is the zone's own trip rather than a constant, for the same
      reason the rest of the daemon reads its trips instead of carrying a table.

    - **Every paused governor is resumed at startup.** A hold lives in the kernel,
      not in this process, so one left behind by a daemon that died is still in
      force with nothing tracking it.

    - **A hold is deliberately not persisted**, which is the one way it differs
      from a plain speed. A persisted speed is replayed into a board whose governor
      overrules it immediately, so the worst it can do is be briefly wrong. A
      persisted hold would come back after a reboot with nothing regulating the fan
      and nobody present who remembers asking for it.

??? note "2.20.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`bmcd_process_threads`** (SQU-172). The companion to
      `bmcd_process_resident_bytes`, and the number that says *which kind* of
      growth is happening: a heap leak grows the resident set with the thread count
      flat, while a leaked task or an unreaped blocking thread grows both, because
      every thread carries a stack.

      Added because the 2026-09-09 outage could not be attributed. The board's
      memory series was queried afterwards and settles one thing: available memory
      fell about 0.95 MB a minute from 01:15 and **recovered at each daemon
      restart** (+3.4 MB, then +10.7 MB), so the memory was held by this process
      and freed when it exited. What it does not settle is whether that was the
      heap or threads. This metric answers that at a glance next time.

      Read from `/proc/self/status`, not by counting `/proc/self/task`, which would
      be a directory read per scrape on a 116 MB board.

    **Changed**

    - **The hardware-less build starts** (SQU-117). `run_event_listener` opens
      `/dev/input/event0`, which exists only on the board, and returned an error
      `main` propagated -- so `--features stubbed`, the build whose entire purpose
      is running without a board, could not start on one. It now warns and carries
      on under that feature only. The default build, which is what the firmware
      compiles, still treats a missing input device as fatal.

      This does not make the daemon properly hardware-less. `/sys/class/thermal`
      is not stubbed at all: on a workstation it enumerates the host's cooling
      devices and reports them as the board's. See SQU-117 for the rest.


    **Added**

    - **CI compiles for the board** (SQU-171). 2.15.0 multiplied two `statvfs`
      counts, which are `u64` on x86-64 and `u32` on this board's 32-bit ARM. Every
      CI job was green and the Buildroot cross-compile failed two hours later,
      because that build was the only thing in the estate that compiled this daemon
      for the target.

      A new `cross` job runs `cargo check` against
      `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` with an armhf sysroot, in about twenty
      seconds. Verified by reintroducing the 2.15.0 expression on a scratch tree:
      clippy stays green while the new job fails with `expected u32, found u64` at
      the comparison. That asymmetry is the whole point.

      The board is actually built **soft-float** (`BR2_ARM_EABI=y`), so its triple
      is `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabi` -- Debian's `armel`, which Ubuntu does not
      carry. The hard-float target stands in for it, and the job asserts what makes
      that safe: rustc's cfg for the two differs in `target_abi` and nothing else,
      so type layout and integer widths are identical. The assertion fails if they
      ever diverge further.

??? note "2.19.1 — 9 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **Two strings had source indentation in the middle of a sentence.** A literal
      wrapped across source lines and joined by rustfmt keeps the leading spaces of
      the continuation. Nothing complains: it compiles, it renders, and the
      exposition stays valid Prometheus.

      One was the `# HELP` text of `bmcd_firmware_promotion_total`, which is
      published to every scraper and shown in dashboard tooltips. The other was the
      error shown when parking an image with no SD card mounted.

    - **A test that covered nothing.** The guard written for the above passed with
      the defect still present: both metric fixtures leave `promotion_history` at
      `None`, so neither renders the family the test was written for. It now fills
      the optional fields, and asserts the family is in the output before checking
      it -- so the test cannot go quiet again.

??? note "2.19.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **A rollback can be named** (SQU-158). The interface said *"Rollback: version
      not readable"* — honest, because that volume is never mounted, and useless to
      somebody deciding whether to press Reboot.

      Only the stager ever knows: by the time the gate runs it is the *new* image
      reading `/etc/os-release`. So both stagers now write `REPLACES=` into the
      staged note, `S99postupdate` copies it to `/mnt/overlay/rollback-version` at
      the instant it promotes, and `firmware_slots` reports it as the rollback
      slot's version.

      A board with no such file still renders "not readable". The version is
      reported when it was recorded and never guessed — the same rule the rest of
      this endpoint follows.

??? note "2.18.0 — 9 September 2026"

    The board wedged at 02:11 UTC after losing roughly a megabyte a minute under
    continuous polling (SQU-172). Its kernel still answered ICMP; nothing
    listened. The four compute modules were untouched. Recovering it needs a
    person at the rack, and the metrics could only show the *board's* memory
    falling — not what was consuming it. These three changes are so the next
    occurrence is diagnosable, and so one of the plausible causes cannot happen.

    **Added**

    - **`bmcd_process_resident_bytes`**, this daemon's own resident set from
      `/proc/self/statm`. Board memory says the board is being consumed; only this
      says by whom. Its absence is why the diagnosis above had to be argued from
      timing rather than read off a graph.

    **Fixed**

    - **The catalogue's `refreshing` flag can no longer stick.** It was cleared by
      a statement after `fan_out().await`, so a panic anywhere in the fan-out left
      it set for ever — and the interface polls every two seconds for as long as
      it is set. One browser tab left open then becomes a permanent 2-second poll
      of a board with 116 MB of RAM. It is cleared by a drop guard now, which runs
      on a panic as well as on success.

    **Changed**

    - `FRESH_AFTER_ERROR` carries the arithmetic that makes it consequential: one
      configured source publishes no checksums and therefore errors routinely, so
      this two-minute value is the interval that actually governs, and each expiry
      spawns a shell and a `curl` per source.

??? note "2.17.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`bmcd_firmware_promotion_total{result}`** (SQU-141), counted from the
      gate's own log. Its history lived only in `/mnt/overlay/postupdate.log`, so
      "nineteen consecutive clean promotions" was a number counted by hand and
      written on a website, where it went stale.

      It had also gone *wrong*: the board's own log says **fifteen boots ran the
      gate and one was refused** — fourteen promotions, not nineteen. The
      hand-counted figure had drifted, which is the entire argument for the
      metric. The site's number will link to a query instead of a claim.

      `promoted` is derived as attempts minus rollbacks, because the gate has no
      single line meaning *kept*: it can finish through the metrics check, by
      skipping that check on a board with no `curl`, or by promoting anyway when
      there is no volume to fall back to. Deriving covers all three. The one
      inaccuracy is a board cut off mid-gate, whose unfinished attempt counts as
      promoted — said plainly in the metric's help text rather than hidden.
    - `firmware_slots` carries `promotion_history`, so the same counts are
      available without a scrape credential.

??? note "2.16.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **One path per operation** (SQU-149, step 1). `GET /api/bmc/thermal`,
      `POST /api/bmc/hostname`, and thirty-three more, each reaching **the same
      arm of the same dispatcher** as its `?opt=&type=` form — there is no second
      implementation to drift. The legacy form stays exactly as it is; it is what
      upstream's `tpi`, this fork's `tpi`, the web interface and a decade of
      scripts speak.

      What differs, and only on the new paths: a success answers with the bare
      result rather than `{"response":[{"result":…}]}`; a refusal answers with
      `application/problem+json` (RFC 9457) carrying the same message the legacy
      form puts in `result`; mutations are `POST` and take parameters as a form or
      a JSON body as well as in the query string, with the query string winning on
      a clash. `POST /firmware/sources` and `POST /config` accept the document
      itself as the JSON body — the shape a person would write — rather than only
      the escaped-string-in-a-parameter shape the legacy form needs.

    - **`GET /api/bmc/openapi.json`**, OpenAPI 3.1, built from the same table that
      registers the routes, so an operation cannot be documented without existing
      or exist without being documented. This release describes every operation's
      path, method, summary, the parameters that are known, and the error shape.
      **Response bodies are still `{}`**: typing them from the serde types the
      handlers return is the next step, and an untyped-but-honest response is
      better than a typed one guessed from memory — the day before this was
      written, a client shipped three formatters against shapes this daemon has
      never sent.

    **Changed**

    - `api_entry`'s dispatch is a function of its own, with two callers.

??? note "2.15.1 — 9 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **Park mode did not compile for the board.** `statvfs`'s block counts are
      `u64` on x86-64 and **`u32` on this board's 32-bit ARM**, so
      `blocks_available() * fragment_size()` built on a workstation and failed to
      cross-compile — and would have overflowed at 4 GB if it had. Cast to `u64`
      before multiplying, which is what `select_staging_dir` two hundred lines
      below already does.

      Caught by the firmware build, not by `just check`. That is the point worth
      recording: **a green workstation check is not evidence the daemon builds for
      the board.** Nothing in this repository's CI cross-compiles; the firmware
      build is the only thing that does, and it is two hours long.

      The widening is a small generic rather than a cast at the call site, because
      neither `as u64` nor `u64::from` works on both: both are required for the
      target and both trip clippy on the host, where the types already match. A
      generic conversion is correct on both platforms and carries the reason with
      it, which a lint suppression would not.

??? note "2.15.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`type=thermal` reports each zone's trip points** (SQU-135). The governor is
      `step_wise`, so the fan's step is a *consequence* of which trips the board
      has crossed — and "the fan is on step 4" with no reason attached is the
      question this fork was asked to investigate. Measured on the board:
      `fan_min` 20 °C, `fan_low` 45 °C, `fan_mid` 60 °C, `fan_high` 70 °C, all
      `active`, plus `hot` at 95 °C; the board reads 50.6 °C, which is above
      `fan_low`, which is step 4. Nothing mysterious, and now nothing hidden.

      Read from sysfs rather than written into a client, for the same reason the
      cooling levels are: it is a fact about *this* board. The trip type is passed
      through as the kernel spells it rather than mapped, so a client that meets an
      unfamiliar one shows it instead of swallowing it.

??? note "2.14.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **Config export and import** (SQU-142). `opt=get&type=config` returns
      everything a person has configured as one JSON document — hostname, time
      servers, firmware sources, node names — and `opt=set&type=config` applies
      one. Board B is a named milestone, and the first thing anyone will want is
      "make it like board A"; today that is five settings re-entered by hand plus a
      metrics token re-pasted into a scrape config.

      **An allow-list, never "everything on the overlay."** The overlay also
      carries `htoprc` and a zero-byte `crond.reboot`, residue of tools that were
      removed, and a wholesale copy would clone that junk to a board that never had
      them.

      **The token is what makes an export sensitive.** `secrets=1` includes the
      metrics token; without it the key is absent from the document entirely rather
      than present and empty. `contains_secrets` is on the document's face, because
      the difference decides how the file has to be handled and nobody will
      remember which request produced it. A token being imported is validated as
      hexadecimal — it is written into a `KEY=VALUE` file and used as a Basic-auth
      password, so a newline or a colon in it would forge a field or split a
      credential.

      **Import is deliberately not transactional.** A hostname and a set of
      firmware sources cannot be rolled back together, and reporting a partial
      apply as a failure would leave an operator unsure which half took. Every
      field reports its own outcome as applied, skipped or failed.

      **`power_on_time` is never imported.** It is when *this* board last powered a
      node on; carried to another board it would report an uptime that never
      happened.

      The network configuration is not included and will not be: it is per-board by
      definition and already has its own reset path.
    - `metrics_token::peek()` reads the stored token without minting one. A backup
      must record what a board has, not create a credential as a side effect of
      being backed up — which `ensure()` would have done.

??? note "2.13.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **The time sources are a setting** (SQU-167). `opt=get&type=ntp` returns the
      configured servers, whether the running image can accept any, and the clock's
      state; `opt=set&type=ntp&servers=a,b` replaces them and reloads chrony live.

      The image ships `pool pool.ntp.org iburst`, so a board synchronises straight
      to the public pool with no way to change that short of an SSH session. The
      RTC covers boot, so this is not about correctness at power-on: it is about
      the one time somebody is standing at the board — a WAN outage — when chrony
      loses its only source and the clock quietly stops being disciplined.

      Written as a chrony `sourcedir` file rather than by rewriting
      `/etc/chrony.conf`: that config is in the read-only image, and
      `chronyc reload sources` picks up the change without restarting chronyd or
      losing the discipline it has built up. The first server is written with
      chrony's `prefer`, and only the first — chrony treats several preferred
      sources as equals, which is not what an ordered list means.

      Server names are validated against an allow-list before they are written,
      and that is not politeness: the lines are `server <value> iburst` in another
      daemon's config file, so a value carrying a newline would append directives
      of its own. `configurable` reports false on an image whose `chrony.conf`
      predates the `sourcedir` line, because a setting that is saved and silently
      never read is worse than one that is absent.

    - **The hostname is a control** (SQU-138). `opt=get&type=hostname` returns the
      live name and the one that takes effect at the next boot — they differ when
      someone has run `hostname` by hand — and `opt=set&type=hostname&name=…`
      changes both and restarts `mdnsd` so the board stops advertising the name it
      no longer has.

      Validated as a single DNS label: letters, digits and hyphens, at most 63,
      no leading or trailing hyphen, and **no dots**. The file format would accept
      a qualified name and `mdnsd` would then advertise `a.b.local`, which is not
      what anyone meant.

      Renaming changes the `instance` label on every metrics series, so a
      Prometheus history does not follow it. That is a decision, not a side
      effect, and it belongs to whoever presses the button — the interface says so
      before it happens.

??? note "2.12.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **Park an uploaded image instead of installing it** (SQU-134).
      `opt=set&type=firmware&park=1` writes the image to `/mnt/sdcard/firmware/`
      and stops: nothing is staged, nothing is armed, and the catalogue's `local`
      source lists it on the next read like any other candidate.

      Until now an upload was never a thing you *had*, only a thing that
      *happened* — `os_update` stages into a scratch directory, runs `osupdate` on
      it at once, and deletes the directory. That made the browser's upload
      control a second way to install, bypassing the catalogue, so an operator
      could upload one image and install another with the interface never showing
      which.

      Three refusals, each for a measured reason. The card must be mounted:
      `/mnt/sdcard` is an empty directory when no card is in the slot, and writing
      there fills the root filesystem instead. It must have room. And the write
      goes to a `.partial` file that is renamed only once it is complete and
      synced, because a truncated image in the directory the catalogue reads would
      be offered for install.

      Parking does **not** make the already-staged refusal, and that is
      deliberate: nothing is being armed, so a board with an image already staged
      can still be given another to choose from later.

??? note "2.11.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **The catalogue no longer blocks the page, or every other request with it**
      (SQU-143, the cause behind SQU-132). Measured on the board first, because the
      ticket held a hypothesis and not a diagnosis:

      | request | before |
      |---|---|
      | `firmware_available&refresh=1`, four sources | **15.9 s** |
      | the same, asking for one source | **15.7 s** |
      | cached | 0.18 s |

      Three faults, compounding. The fan-out ran the sources through a single
      `spawn_blocking` and a `.map()`, so it cost their **sum** rather than the
      slowest. The cache mutex was **held for the whole of it**, so a "check now"
      froze every other reader too — including a page that wanted nothing but the
      cached list, which is why the freeze looked like it happened on open. And
      asking for one source refreshed all four, because the refresh was never per
      source at all.

      Now: one `spawn_blocking` per source through a `JoinSet`, answers reordered
      to the configured order; the lock taken only to store the result; and a
      caller gets the cached catalogue at once with `refreshing` set while the
      refresh runs behind it. `refresh=1` starts that refresh instead of waiting
      for the entry to age out, and returns immediately.

    **Added**

    - `Catalog.refreshing` and `Catalog.age_seconds`, so a page can draw a spinner
      on its own control and say how old the list is without parsing a timestamp
      and trusting two clocks. `refreshing` is omitted when false, so a settled
      catalogue serialises exactly as before.
    - The catalogue is primed at start-up. Otherwise the first caller after a boot
      pays for the fan-out, and that is the person watching a board come back from
      a firmware update.
    - A refresh already in flight is joined, not duplicated: four sources would
      otherwise become twelve requests against a GitHub quota of sixty an hour.

??? note "2.10.1 — 9 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **A parked image is ordered against what is running** (SQU-169). A local
      candidate was reported with an `unknown` relation whatever its name, so a
      `v2.8.1-rc1` on the SD card while the board ran v2.8.0 showed as `?`, sorted
      under "older or unrelated", and `tpi firmware check` never mentioned it.
      Found while flashing the gate test image.

      The old comment argued that a file on a card carries no promise that its name
      reflects its contents. True — and that is what the `trust` column says, which
      already reads `unverified` for every local file. Declining to order as well
      told the user the same thing twice and hid a real upgrade. Version-shaped
      names are now ordered; anything else still declines.
    - Local candidates are listed newest first by that same ordering. A lexical
      sort put `v2.9.0` above `v2.10.0` in a list whose own `relation` fields said
      the opposite.
    - `prerelease` is set from the tag rather than hard-coded to `false`, so a
      candidate can be labelled as one.

    **Added**

    - `app::version`, an ordering for release tags, with the two rules this fork
      has already got wrong somewhere: numbers compare as numbers (`2.10.0` is
      after `2.9.0`, which a text compare reverses), and a prerelease comes before
      its own release (`v2.8.1-rc1` is after `v2.8.0` and before `v2.8.1`).
      Anything not version-shaped compares to nothing at all, because a build
      stamped `VERSION=local` once sorted first and made every release on the list
      look like an upgrade.

??? note "2.10.0 — 8 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - Rust 1.98.1 across the workspace, dependencies refreshed, and 23 clippy lints
      fixed rather than suppressed. `NodeType`, `DummyValidator` and
      `FalseValidator` deleted as unused; an `unreachable!()` in `utils` replaced by
      `as_chunks::<2>()`, which makes the case impossible instead of asserting it.

??? note "2.9.0 — 8 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - Firmware sources point at `excavador-turing/BMC-Firmware`. A board that still
      holds a retired location is migrated on load and the result persisted, so the
      move needs no action on the board.

??? note "2.8.0 — 8 September 2026 (no release of its own)"

    **Added**

    - Firmware sources are configurable and catalogued: GitHub releases, an HTTP
      directory, or the SD card, each candidate reported with how it compares to
      the running version and how much is known about its integrity.
    - `firmware_install`, so a chosen version can be staged.

??? note "2.7.0 — 7 September 2026 (no release of its own)"

    **Added**

    - `/metrics` authenticates with its own token rather than the root password, so
      a scrape credential cannot touch `/api/bmc`.
    - The daemon reports whether a newer firmware release exists.

    **Changed**

    - Every switch metric series carries `kind`, not only the ones that are present.

??? note "2.5.0 — 7 September 2026 (no release of its own)"

    **Added**

    - `firmware_info` reports *which* image is staged, not merely that one is.
    - The kernel release is reported on the About page.
    - A release is published when a version tag is pushed.

??? note "2.4.0 — 6 September 2026 (no release of its own)"

    **Added**

    - A Prometheus scrape endpoint, behind authentication.
    - The SoC temperature and the cooling state, the fan's real duty from the
      device tree, the running firmware slot and what a rollback lands on, and the
      condition of the BMC itself.
    - A browser can authenticate the serial websocket.

    **Fixed**

    - `/info` is no longer served unauthenticated over plain HTTP (SQU-125).
    - A ban answers with 429 and a `Retry-After` rather than "wrong password".
    - Only `http/1.1` is offered over ALPN, so h2 framing is unreachable (SQU-126).
