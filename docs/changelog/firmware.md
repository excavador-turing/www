# BMC-Firmware

The firmware image — what you flash onto the board. It carries a `bmcd`, a `BMC-UI` and a `tpi`, so this is the version to quote when reporting anything.

Newest release **v2.38.0**, 22 September 2026. 35 in total. Each entry is this repository's own [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/excavador-turing/BMC-Firmware/blob/hive/CHANGELOG.md) where it has one, and the release note where it does not — fetched by `just refresh-changelog`, so this page and the repository cannot disagree.

[Every release on GitHub](https://github.com/excavador-turing/BMC-Firmware/releases) carries a `.tpu` OTA package, an `.img` recovery image and a `SHA256SUMS` to check them against. New ones come through [the feed](../feed.xml).

!!! note "Checking what you downloaded"

    ```console
    $ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
    ```

    `SHA256SUMS` lists bare filenames, so run it from the directory holding the files. Upstream publishes no checksums at all, on either of its two catalogues — see [upstream vs this fork](../reference/comparison.md).

???+ note "v2.38.0 — 22 September 2026"

    Pins **BMC-UI 3.37.0**. bmcd stays at 2.38.2 and tpi at 1.10.0. One change,
    from a reader who had just done an update for the first time.

    **Changed**

    - **The Firmware tab now says what the board is doing while it installs.**
      Installing from a source took about half a minute of silence — a greyed
      button and nothing else — because the daemon does the whole job inside one
      request (download the image, check its sum, write it to the spare slot,
      arm the next boot) and answers when it is done. A reader wondered whether
      to refresh; he did not need to, and now the page says so: the button reads
      *Installing…* and a status line counts "about 26 s, now at N", the number
      measured on a real board like the reboot banner's. Past it the line says
      the board is still working and that a slow link takes longer. Nothing is
      armed until the board says staged, and the page says that too.

      This is also the first release built with the new CI: the cross-toolchain
      comes prebuilt from an image, the Rust packages from a compiler cache, and
      a firmware build takes about eleven minutes instead of twenty-four. Nothing
      in the image changes because of that — the compiler is the same binary,
      built from the same defconfig in the same container — and both boards
      here are the check.

??? note "v2.37.0 — 22 September 2026"

    Pins **BMC-UI 3.36.0**. bmcd stays at 2.38.2 and tpi at 1.10.0. One fix, and
    it is the one a new board meets first.

    **Fixed**

    - **The password form would not accept typing, in any of its three boxes.**
      The interface's shared text field dropped the change handler for password
      inputs, and a React field that holds its value but cannot report a change
      is read-only: every keystroke was reverted, silently, with markup that
      looks perfect. It hit the password card on Access **and the page a board
      still on its shipped password shows instead of everything else** — so such
      a board could not be taken off that password from a browser at all, only
      over SSH. Logging in was unaffected, which is why it went unnoticed: that
      form reads the page on submit rather than holding state.

      Reported as [#48](https://github.com/excavador-turing/BMC-Firmware/issues/48)
      by a user on v2.34.0, and present since long before this fork. The release
      also adds the gate that would have caught it: the interface's CI now types
      into every visible box of every tab and fails on one that does not keep
      what was typed. Nothing that existed could see it — it builds, it lints,
      it renders, and the page-length gate measures height.

??? note "v2.36.0 — 22 September 2026"

    Pins **bmcd 2.38.2** and **BMC-UI 3.35.0**; tpi stays at 1.10.0. Two fixes,
    both from one report the day after v2.35.0 shipped, by the same reader whose
    report shaped it, on the same 2.4 board: a static address that lost its
    resolvers at every reboot, and a firmware check that said "nothing new" on a
    board that could not resolve anything at all. They share a cause — the board
    had no DNS — and neither of them said so.

    **Fixed**

    - **A static address came back from every reboot with no resolvers.** The
      stanza the address card writes carried a `#` — the tag the DHCP client
      puts on its own resolv.conf lines, kept so a later lease can replace them
      — and the board's `ifup` reads `#` anywhere on a line as a comment. The
      hook that rebuilds `/etc/resolv.conf` (a link into memory on this image,
      empty at every boot) was cut off, the shell refused it, and `ifup br0`
      failed at every boot after the address was already on the bridge. The
      board came up reachable, with a clock that could not find its server. The
      hook now spells the character so it survives; a board the old stanza was
      already written to is repaired the first time this daemon starts, without
      waiting for the address to be changed again.

    - **A firmware source it could not reach said "nothing new".**
      `tpi-selfupdate --list` calls `die` when curl cannot reach the source, and
      `die` exits — but on the left of a pipe it exits only its own subshell.
      The JSON array had already been opened, the loop then read nothing, and
      the script closed the array and exited 0: a well-formed `"releases":[]`
      with the real reason on stderr, which nobody was reading. bmcd took that
      as "this source offers nothing" and the firmware page said there was no
      update, on a board that simply had no DNS. Reported alongside the clock,
      from the same board; reproduced on board B with an empty `resolv.conf` —
      four sources, no candidates, no errors.

      Both listing branches now collect into a variable first, where a non-zero
      exit is visible, and print nothing on stdout unless they succeeded.
      `tests/listing.sh` stubs `curl` and covers it in dash, busybox ash and
      sh; run against the original script it reports five failures, which is
      how it was checked. bmcd 2.38.2 is the other half: it reads the exit
      status before the output, so the next script that fails cheerfully cannot
      put the page back to lying.

    **Changed**

    - **BMC-UI 3.35.0 changes nothing on a board.** It teaches the site's demo
      to run the address flow — apply, the window, confirm, revert — so a
      reader can try it. Pinned because a release ships the latest of every
      component, the rule this image has kept since v2.26.0.

??? note "v2.35.0 — 21 September 2026"

    Pins **bmcd 2.38.0**, **BMC-UI 3.34.1** and **tpi 1.10.0**. All three come
    from one Discord report on 2026-09-21: a user on a 2.4 board — the second
    2.4 board confirmed on this fork — had set the Split layout up, given the
    BMC a fixed address over SSH, and then found the clock saying "NOT
    synchronised" with nothing to act on. Every component's own changelog has
    the detail; what follows is what this image adds on top of them.

    **Added**

    - **The board's own address, from the Network tab.** DHCP or a static
      address with its prefix, gateway, resolvers and search domain, beside the
      hostname. The rules are the board's: it refuses what could never be reached
      (a gateway off the subnet, the network or broadcast address) and warns
      about what is merely unwise — a static address with no resolver, which is
      exactly the state the reporter's board was in. **Apply** puts the address
      on the bridge and keeps it only when a confirmation reaches the board *at
      the new address*; otherwise the old one comes back by itself after the
      window. The bridge is never brought down, so the modules' ports stay in it
      throughout. `tpi network address` does the same from a shell. Only a
      confirmed address is written to `/etc/network/interfaces` — in the same
      stanza this image ships and migrates, so nothing about boot changed.

    - **The clock says why.** The Time card, `tpi ntp` and `GET ?type=ntp` carry
      chrony's verdict on every source — selected, combined, excluded,
      unreachable, falseticker — and, when chrony has nothing at all, the
      configured names as *unresolved*. That last state is what "no resolver"
      looks like from the outside, and it is what an empty `chronyc sources`
      had been hiding.

    **Changed**

    - **"Reset network" is now "Reset the switch chip"**, which is what it does
      and always did; it never touched the address.

    **Fixed**

    - **The Time and Hostname boxes are no longer blank on a second visit** to
      the tab; both cards seed from the query now. Reported from the same 2.4
      board.
    - **A countdown that could not count**: the switch card read the daemon's
      `{secs_since_epoch, nanos_since_epoch}` as a date and showed NaN.

??? note "v2.34.0 — 20 September 2026"

    Pins **BMC-UI 3.32.0**. bmcd stays at 2.37.0 and tpi at 1.9.0.

    **Changed**

    - **Which module: four pills, not a drop-down.** Console, USB and Flash each
      opened with a list that unfolded to show four fixed entries, one already
      chosen. The three tabs now share one picker, Node 1 to 4 side by side with
      the chosen one green — the same change the fleet shows, because it is one
      component serving both.

??? note "v2.33.0 — 20 September 2026"

    Pins **bmcd 2.37.0**, **BMC-UI 3.30.0** and **tpi 1.9.0** — the first release
    carrying the on-board switch, the certificate endpoint and the forced password
    change. Every component's own changelog has the detail; what follows is what
    this image adds on top of them.

    **Added**

    - **A Certificates section in the README**: what the board issues itself, that
      it renews and now reissues on rename, that it never touches a certificate it
      did not issue, the three ways to install your own, and why the serial console
      is the one tab that breaks on an untrusted certificate.

    **Fixed**

    - **A renamed board reissues its own certificate.** The self-signed generator
      reissued on four conditions — no certificate, a mismatched pair, expiry
      within the renewal window, and never for a certificate it did not issue —
      and none of them was *the board is not called that any more*. The names were
      computed and used only when issuing, never compared against what was on
      disk.

      So renaming a board with `tpi hostname`, or letting its address move, left
      the old names in the certificate **for up to 825 days** while every browser
      rejected it for a name mismatch, on a board that was otherwise perfectly
      healthy. It is the one trigger a "reissue now" button would have been for,
      and it is detectable, so it should never have needed a button.

      The comparison asks openssl one name at a time with `-checkhost` and
      `-checkip`, and reads **what it says** rather than what it returns: this
      workstation's openssl exits 1 for a name that is not in the certificate, and
      the one on GitHub's runners exits 0 and says so only in its output. A check
      built on the status passed here and did nothing there — the same bug being
      fixed, inside the fix. There is a test that proves the primitive on whatever
      openssl is present before the rest of the suite trusts it.

      It reads the extension through openssl rather than comparing it as text. Text cannot be made
      to work: the SAN is written `DNS:board,IP:fd00:0:0:0:0:0:1533:6065` and
      printed back as `DNS:board, IP Address:FD00:0:0:0:0:0:1533:6065` — a
      different separator, a different label, and an IPv6 address expanded and
      upper-cased. Normalising that by hand means writing an IPv6 canonicaliser in
      POSIX sh, and getting it subtly wrong means reissuing on **every run**: a new
      key at every boot and every pinned client broken daily, which is a far worse
      failure than the one being fixed. There is a test for that failure as well as
      for the fix.

      The predicate is *every name the board has now is in the certificate*, not
      *the two lists are equal*. An address the board has dropped leaves a stale
      name that asserts something untrue but breaks nothing and is gone at the next
      renewal; a name the board has gained is what breaks browsers, and it is
      caught.

??? note "v2.32.0 — 13 September 2026"

    Pins BMC-UI 3.29.0. bmcd stays at 2.36.3 and tpi is unchanged.

    **Added**

    - **A node armed for USB boot says so, on its own liveness line.** A module
      whose USB-boot pin is held will not boot from its own eMMC. The daemon
      persists that configuration and re-applies it on every start, so a power
      cycle does not clear it, and the reboot that reveals it can be weeks after
      whatever armed it. What you get then is indistinguishable from dead
      hardware: silent on the serial console, off the network, and the board
      still reporting its rail on. Twenty minutes went into exactly that on
      2026-09-12.

      bmcd 2.36.3 already exported `bmcd_node_usb_boot_armed`, which reaches
      whoever armed a module while they still remember doing it. This is the half
      for the other person — the operator already staring at a node that will not
      come up. It leads the liveness line, in red, ahead of power state and link
      state, because both of those read perfectly normal in this failure.

      The USB selector on the same card already showed `Flash` for that node. A
      select says what you may *set*, not what is *wrong*, and says nothing about
      the consequence or the remedy; the note beside the warning names both.

    **Changed**

    - **A toast names the board it is about.** With a fleet on one screen,
      "Flashing started" told you an operation began somewhere, and a
      notification from one board was indistinguishable from the same
      notification from another. Toasts raised inside a board's scope now carry
      that board's name.

??? note "v2.31.0 — 12 September 2026"

    Pins BMC-UI 3.28.0. bmcd stays at 2.36.3 and tpi is unchanged.

    **Fixed**

    - **The console wrote a second copy of its scrollback on every reconnect.**
      Pressing Reconnect keeps the terminal, as it is meant to, and then replayed
      the daemon's whole 16 KiB ring buffer underneath what was already on screen
      — the same lines carrying the same kernel timestamps, twice.

      The replay exists because the daemon forwards only what arrives after a
      subscriber joins; without it a console opened on a module that has been up
      for hours shows nothing at all. It just never asked whether the terminal
      already had that output.

      Clearing first would have fixed the duplication and cost the thing the
      scrollback is for: the daemon keeps only the last 16 KiB and one module boot
      is about 82 KB, so the terminal is the only place a full boot survives.
      Instead the replay works out where what it has already shown ends inside the
      buffer it has just been handed, and writes only what follows. A reconnect
      with nothing new writes nothing; one after a gap writes exactly the gap.

      Redraw is unchanged and still clears first. It answers a different question.

??? note "v2.30.0 — 12 September 2026"

    Pins bmcd 2.36.3. BMC-UI stays at 3.27.0 and tpi is unchanged.

    **Fixed**

    - **The board refused every attempt to resume a TLS session, fatally, and that
      was the intermittent console failure.** A serial console or an API call
      through the fleet gateway would occasionally fail outright, on both boards,
      with nothing in the daemon's log and the board healthy either side of it.

      Envoy keeps one TLS session per upstream cluster and offers it on the next
      connection it opens. On the gateway, a third of all new connections to the
      two boards died that way — 8 of 28 to one, 19 of 45 to the other — while
      every connection taken from the pool was fine, which is what made it look
      random from a browser. Reproduced from a pod on the gateway's own node: 30
      fresh connections all succeeded, and 30 offering back a saved session all
      failed with `tlsv1 alert internal error`.

      OpenSSL will not resume a session on a server that asks for client
      certificates unless the context carries a session id context, and the
      refusal is not a quiet cache miss — it is `internal_error`, fatal, sent
      before a byte of HTTP. The error is raised on the server, which never logged
      it. So the fault arrived with client certificates in 2.30.0 and was
      invisible for six releases, and it was never specific to the gateway: any
      client that resumes hit the same wall.

    **Added**

    - **`/metrics` says which module is armed for USB boot.** Two families:
      `bmcd_node_usb_boot_armed`, one sample per module, and `bmcd_usb_config`,
      which names the node, mode, route and bus type of the *persisted*
      configuration.

      `tpi flash` and `tpi advanced msd` leave that configuration at
      `Flashing(NodeN, …)`, and the daemon re-applies it on every start, which
      asserts the module's USB-boot pin and stops it booting from its own eMMC.
      The module keeps running, because it is already booted — so the fault
      appears at its **next** reboot, possibly weeks later.

      Until now nothing exported that. A module in flash mode is indistinguishable
      from dead hardware from every remote angle: nothing at all on the serial
      console, not even a bootloader banner, because the loader does not use the
      console; nothing on the network; and the BMC reporting the rail on. `tpi usb
      status` cannot separate the two either — it prints the same route for `UsbA`
      and `Flashing`. Measured on hive-6 on 2026-09-12: twenty minutes spent on a
      module that looked dead, with the answer sitting unexported in the daemon's
      own database.

??? note "v2.29.0 — 12 September 2026"

    Pins bmcd 2.36.1. BMC-UI stays at 3.27.0 and tpi is unchanged.

    **Fixed**

    - **Every refusal from the access endpoints answered 500.** Found on bmc-2
      within the hour of flashing v2.28.0, by asking the board the questions its
      new guards are supposed to refuse: they all refused, with the right message,
      and all of them came back `500 Internal Server Error`.

      500 is the canonical retryable status, so a client told 500 for "that
      password is wrong" is invited to retry an answer that will never change, and
      a person reading it is told the board is broken when the request was. The
      guards themselves were correct throughout; only the number on them was
      wrong.

??? note "v2.28.0 — 12 September 2026"

    Pins bmcd 2.36.0 and BMC-UI 3.27.0; tpi is unchanged and already current.

    **Added**

    - **Who may reach a board, from the interface that asks for the password.**
      Settings gains a card for the two things that decide who gets in and which
      until now existed only on the filesystem: the local password, and the
      certificate authority whose client certificates may name an operator. It
      shows how *you* got here first, because an operator arriving through the
      fleet is not holding the board's password and the rest of the card reads
      differently depending on which you are.

      The daemon's rules appear as disabled controls rather than refusals after
      the fact: the current password is required even from an operator a proxy
      vouched for, twelve characters counted as characters, and "stop trusting any
      proxy" is unavailable when you are authenticated by that proxy.

    **Fixed**

    - **The fleet's serial console could not connect.** It refused before opening
      a socket, demanding a session token the fleet has no reason to hold, while
      every other tab on the same page answered normally. The certificate was
      never involved: the browser talks to its own origin and never to a board.
      Through the gateway the browser presents nothing, and the identity is
      attached on a hop it is not part of.

      Proved against bmc-1 through a stand-in for the gateway — `101 Switching
      Protocols`, subprotocol `bmcd.serial.v1` — and then "connected" in a real
      browser with zero console errors.

    ##### Note

    v2.26.0 and v2.27.0 were released without entries here. What they carried is
    recorded in the package hash files, which document every pin bump with its
    measurement: BMC-UI 3.25.0 (the SD card picker and two dead flash buttons) and
    3.26.0 (temperature on Board Health, an honest console hint), and bmcd 2.35.0
    (the catalogue refresh that could wedge for ever, and the on-disk listing).

??? note "v2.27.0 — 12 September 2026"

    The first release that carries the latest of all three: BMC-UI 3.26.0, bmcd
    2.34.0 and tpi 1.8.0.

    **Fixed**

    - **The pin gate moved to the workflow that publishes**, so it can actually
      refuse. It ran where it could report a stale pin and not stop the release,
      which is how v2.26.0 shipped a `tpi` two versions behind the daemon it was
      packaged with.

??? note "v2.26.0 — 11 September 2026"

    Pins BMC-UI 3.25.0: the SD card picker, and the flash button that threw
    instead of flashing.

    ##### Known at the time

    - This release shipped a stale `tpi`. The gate that should have refused it ran
      in a workflow that could not stop a release; v2.27.0 moved it and carries
      the right one.

??? note "v2.25.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **BMC-UI v3.23.0 → v3.24.0: the firmware install confirmation is a modal.**
      It rendered inline, after every candidate. A board with several sources has
      a long catalogue, so pressing INSTALL scrolled the question off the bottom
      of the window — the button appeared to do nothing, and the obvious response
      is to press it again. It now uses the same modal the reboot and node-power
      confirmations use, and its drawer form fixes the phone case the inline panel
      was worst on. Reported from use.

    **Changed**

    - **tpi → v1.7.0**, which releases the fix already on the branch: renaming a
      board no longer claims to move its metrics history, because the series never
      carried a board name.

      Bumped because the pin check added in v2.24.0 caught it — it flagged tpi as
      stale the moment the interface was bumped, which is exactly the drift it was
      written for, on its first real use.

??? note "v2.24.0 — 11 September 2026"

    Everything current: the daemon, the interface and the CLI.

    **Fixed**

    - **bmcd v2.32.0 → v2.34.0.** Two releases.

      **v2.33.0 — a node's USB bus number is not part of its identity, and pinning
      it refused every flash** (SQU-199). The port check that stops a flash of
      node 2 writing node 1 compared the whole path, bus included, against a bus
      hardcoded to 1. This board pairs an OHCI and an EHCI controller as
      **companions for the same physical ports**, so which bus a device lands on is
      decided by its *speed*: the same hub port is `1-1.2` for a full-speed device
      and `2-1.2` for a high-speed one. A Rockchip in maskrom is high-speed, so the
      daemon refused every RK1 it was asked to flash or expose as mass storage,
      with `node 2 requested on 1-1.2; found Rockusb on 2-1.2 instead`, about
      modules that were entirely healthy. **Nothing on this board could be flashed
      through the daemon until this release.**

      **v2.34.0 — the daemon can say what is on the microSD card** (SQU-198). Name,
      size, modified time, and whether each entry could be written to a node.
      `tpi flash --local` already reads images off that card; there was simply no
      way to see what was there, so an operator had to know the path and type it.
      A non-candidate is listed with its reason rather than hidden. Every path is
      confined to the card by one function with its own tests, catching `../..` and
      a symlink off the card with the same rule.

    - **BMC-UI v3.21.0 → v3.23.0.** v3.22.0 stopped the daemon's messages being
      escaped twice — i18next escapes interpolated values and React escapes again,
      so a path arrived as `&#x2F;` in the page.

      v3.23.0 is the fleet gaining every control the board interface has, built
      from the **same components** rather than copies. That reaches this package
      too, because those components are the board's own bundle: toasts were capped
      at one and carried no board name, "don't ask again" for node power was a
      single setting shared by every board, and logout walked out of the
      application under a sub-path. All three are fixed here as well. Export and
      Import configuration is now **Backup and restore**.

    - **tpi → 79ff091: the rename does not move your metrics history.** Renaming a
      board was described as carrying its metrics with it. The series carry no
      board name at all, so nothing moves, and the CLI stops claiming otherwise.

??? note "v2.23.0 — 11 September 2026"

    TLS, made usable rather than merely present.

    **Changed**

    - **bmcd v2.30.0 → v2.32.0: the daemon offers TLS 1.3, with 1.2 as the
      fallback** (SQU-136). Its acceptor was built from Mozilla's version 4
      intermediate profile, which pins the maximum protocol version to TLS 1.2.
      The board's OpenSSL is 3.5.7 and was capable of 1.3 the whole time.

      Not housekeeping. Under TLS 1.2 a client's `supported_groups` extension
      constrains the curve of the **server's** certificate as well as the key
      exchange, so a client whose list stops at P-256 — Envoy's default — cannot
      use a P-384 certificate at all. Every certificate in the estate these boards
      run in is P-384, so the gateway in front of them failed every handshake and
      both boards showed as unreachable behind a login page that worked perfectly.

    - **The self-signed certificate is one a client can actually trust, and it
      renews itself.** The script that issues it, when nobody has installed a real
      certificate, had four problems, each now fixed:

      - It set **no subjectAltName**. Every browser since 2017 matches on the SAN
        and ignores the common name, so that certificate could not be accepted by
        any of them. A self-signed certificate nobody can choose to trust is
        decoration. It now names the board's hostname, its `.local` name and every
        global address it holds.
      - It was valid for **30 days** — openssl's default, never passed — and only
        ever regenerated when a file was missing. A board left running served an
        expired certificate for as long as it stayed up; one here did for over a
        year (SQU-115). It now issues for 825 days and reissues 30 days before
        expiry, so neither a long uptime nor a month powered off produces an
        expired certificate.
      - It generated **RSA 4096** on a board with about 87 MB of usable RAM. Now
        EC P-384, the estate's standing key type: stronger per bit, faster, smaller.
      - Its pair check ran `openssl rsa -noout -modulus`, which **fails on any key
        that is not RSA** — and the failure branch deletes both files and
        regenerates. An operator installing an EC or Ed25519 certificate could have
        it destroyed at the next boot. It now compares public keys, which works for
        every key type, and **refuses to touch any certificate it did not issue**:
        a certificate from a real CA is left exactly where it is, expired or not,
        with a warning rather than a replacement.

      Fifteen assertions cover this in CI, including the two that matter most: a
      certificate this script did not issue comes out byte for byte unchanged.

    **Added**

    - **`/metrics` says when the serving certificate expires** —
      `bmcd_tls_certificate_expiry_timestamp_seconds` — and which key it is built
      on, `bmcd_tls_certificate_info{key="ecdsa-p384"}`. A number a scrape can
      alert on is the difference between noticing an expiry and a calendar
      reminder somebody stops reading. A date the daemon cannot parse reports no
      series at all rather than a zero, which would read as 1970 and fire every
      rule written against it.

    ##### Confirmed

    - **Every key an operator might install is served**, over TLS 1.3 and 1.2
      alike: RSA, EC P-256, P-384 and P-521, and Ed25519. Already true, now a test
      that performs a real handshake per key type against the real acceptor.

??? note "v2.22.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **bmcd v2.29.0 → v2.30.0: a proxy holding a certificate from a trusted CA
      can name the human it authenticated** (SQU-136). `tls.client_ca` turns it
      on and is absent by default, so a board that never gets one behaves exactly
      as before. `tls.identity_header` says which header carries the name. A name
      without a certificate is nobody, and that rule has a test.

      This is what makes a fleet interface possible without giving anything a
      password to every board.

??? note "v2.21.0 — 11 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - **BMC-UI v3.19.0 → v3.21.0**, two interface releases in one pin. v3.20.0
      put the Nodes page on a two-by-two grid — four full-width rows scrolled on
      a 1080-pixel screen with a third of the width empty beside each — and added
      the demo mode that answers from captured fixtures, which is what
      turingpi.xyz serves as its live demo. v3.21.0 tightened that grid until it
      also fits the demo's frame: measured at 868 pixels in the 1664 by 879 frame
      the site gives it.
    - **The Grafana dashboard names the board on every series.** With two boards
      reporting, a panel that did not carry the instance label was drawing both
      as one line.

??? note "v2.20.0 — 10 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **bmcd v2.28.0 → v2.29.0: `bmcd_firmware_last_promotion_timestamp_seconds`**
      (SQU-141). The counter beside it says how often the gate reached a verdict;
      this says when the last one was, which is what an alert on "no promotion
      since" needs. Absent rather than wrong when the board's clock cannot be
      trusted, and only UTC is accepted.

    **Removed**

    - **BMC-UI v3.18.0 → v3.19.0: the red maskrom warning on the flash page**
      (SQU-157, with SQU-105). It said the daemon writes to whichever module is in
      maskrom first, whatever the picker says. That was true and is not any more.

      Proven on the board on 2026-09-10 before the warning came down: with **two**
      modules in maskrom at once, flashing node 2 left node 4 answering `talosctl`
      with the cluster's certificate authority while node 2 rejected it as unknown.
      A node that was overwritten cannot present the cluster CA; one that was not
      cannot fail to. The write landed where it was aimed, and node 2 was
      reprovisioned back into the cluster afterwards.

      A warning that is no longer true is worse than no warning: it teaches people
      to ignore the red ones.

??? note "v2.19.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - **`tpi` v1.5.1 → v1.6.0: the check that caused all of this is gone.**

      Three releases in a row carried attempts to make `firmware install` resolve
      a version correctly against the board's cached listing. The listing lags a
      release by up to half an hour, so `firmware check` would print
      `install it with: tpi firmware install <v>` and the next command would
      reject it. v2.17.0's attempt was inert; v2.18.0's worked by waiting up to
      three minutes.

      Both were the wrong shape. The resolution existed because of a comment
      claiming the board would otherwise fail "in the middle of a download".
      Measured: the daemon answers **400 in 0.48 s** with
      `tpi-selfupdate: cannot fetch SHA256SUMS for v9.9.9`, before any download,
      staging nothing. There was nothing to protect against.

      So the listing now informs the confirmation line and cannot refuse, and the
      board — which is what downloads the image — decides. On a version that
      exists nowhere: 140 s and a possibly-wrong refusal before, 1 s and the
      board's own message now.

    **Fixed**

    - **`tpi firmware list --refresh` could confirm that a release did not
      exist.** It waited 60 s for a poll, then gave up and printed the previous
      listing with nothing said, indistinguishable from a current one. Polls
      measured on this board took 74 s, 78 s and 140 s. Now four minutes, it says
      when it gives up, and `list` prints how old the listing is on every run —
      the daemon had always sent that, and the client discarded it.

??? note "v2.18.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **`tpi` v1.5.0 → v1.5.1: the fix v2.17.0 shipped did not work.** `firmware
      install` still refused the command `firmware check` had just printed.

      v1.5.0 asked the board to re-poll its firmware sources and resolved against
      the answer — but `firmware_available&refresh=1` does not fetch. The daemon
      *spawns* the poll and returns the cached list immediately with `refreshing`
      set, so the second resolution ran against the same stale list as the first.
      Confirmed on the board: a forced request came back in one second carrying
      the same `checked_at` it had before the call.

      v1.5.1 waits for the poll to land before re-resolving, keyed on
      `checked_at`, which advances exactly once a poll completes. Bounded at 180 s,
      and a refusal that hits the bound says the poll did not finish rather than
      claiming no source has the version.

      Proved on the board before this release rather than after, with a version
      that exists nowhere so nothing could install either way:

      | build | elapsed | `checked_at` |
      |---|---|---|
      | 1.5.0 | 1 s | unchanged |
      | 1.5.1 | 58 s | 20:50:57 → 20:52:11 |

??? note "v2.17.0 — 9 September 2026"

    > **The `tpi` change below is inert.** It describes behaviour v1.5.0 did not
    > have; v2.18.0 carries the version that does. Kept as written, because a
    > release note that quietly becomes true later teaches nobody anything.



    **Changed**

    - **`tpi` v1.4.0 → v1.5.0.** `firmware install` no longer refuses the command
      `firmware check` just printed.

      The two read different caches with independent timing: `check` asks the
      board's update checker, which reaches GitHub, while `install` resolved the
      requested version against the firmware catalogue, whose entries are fresh
      for half an hour. Reproduced on a board twenty-seven seconds after v2.16.0
      published — `check` said `install it with: tpi firmware install v2.16.0` and
      exited 10; the next command said `no source offers v2.16.0` and exited 1.

      `install` now re-resolves against a forced poll before believing no source
      has the version. The successful path pays nothing. The refusal itself stays:
      posting an unresolved version would fail in the middle of a download rather
      than before it starts.

??? note "v2.16.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - **bmcd v2.27.0 → v2.28.0.** The ten handlers that assembled their answer
      with `json!` now serialise named types, so every read operation in the
      OpenAPI document describes what it answers with and none is left as "not
      described here". The shapes are reconstructions of what the daemon already
      sent, odd corners preserved and explained: power, USB and SD card answer a
      one-element array because that is upstream's shape; node power reports
      strings because an unreadable rail is `Unknown` and a boolean could not say
      so; the SD card's used-bytes field is `use` on the wire because `use` is
      what upstream sent and a Rust keyword.

      **Naming a cooling device that does not exist now answers 400, not 500.**
      A client branches on status, and 500 is the retryable one — so the old
      answer asked callers to retry something that could never change.

    - **BMC-UI v3.17.0 → v3.18.0.** Twenty-three hand-written response interfaces
      become aliases onto types generated from the `openapi.json` bmcd publishes,
      and CI regenerates and diffs, so a hand edit or a pin moved without
      regenerating fails there rather than on a board. Nothing changes on screen.

      Two things this shook out. The generated types are stricter than the
      hand-written ones — schemars cannot tell a field always sent as `null` from
      one omitted when empty — so a reading is now recognised by a type guard
      rather than by a runtime check the compiler could not see. And BMC-UI's
      quality workflow had been `pull_request` only, in a fork that never opens
      one, so its lint, build and tests had never run in CI at all.

    **Added**

    - **`docs/architecture.md`** — where the daemon, the interface and the
      listeners live, the board measurements the arrangement rests on, and what
      was declined along the way. Linked from the README.

    **Fixed**

    - **CI's shell install no longer fails on a third-party apt repository it does
      not use.** A hash mismatch in the runner image's Google Chrome repository
      failed the promotion-gate job on a documentation-only change. The step now
      drops the runner's third-party `.list` files before updating.

??? note "v2.15.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - **`/metrics` is served on port 9110, plain HTTP, with no credential**
      (SQU-178). It used to sit on `:443` beside the API and the web interface,
      behind TLS and a token of its own.

      The token existed for one reason: so that a credential in a scrape config
      could not also reach `/api/bmc` and power four compute modules off. On a
      listener that serves nothing but `/metrics` there is nothing else to reach,
      so the property survives and the mechanism is a port instead of a secret.
      The TLS was always scraped with verification disabled, because this board's
      certificate is expired and carries no SAN, so it bought nothing and cost a
      handshake per scrape on a Cortex-A7.

      **A scrape config pointed at `:443` will stop working.** Point it at 9110,
      drop the basic auth and drop the TLS block.

    - **The promotion gate no longer depends on the `/api/bmc` loopback bypass.**
      It used to reach through it to mint itself a metrics token before it could
      check the endpoint; it now makes one plain request. The on-board `tpi` is
      the only remaining user of that bypass.

      `tests/gate.sh` shrank with it — the stub's token behaviour and the three
      cases exercising token retrieval are gone, replaced by one case for an
      endpoint that answers with the wrong body. Ten cases, all passing, and
      proven to fail by accepting any body at all.

    - **bmcd v2.23.0 → v2.27.0**, **`tpi` v1.3.0 → v1.4.0**, **BMC-UI v3.15.0 →
      v3.17.0**. Beyond the metrics change: the OpenAPI document now describes
      what its operations answer with and is checked against what the daemon
      sends, `bmcd --openapi` prints it without a board, and the interface folded
      its standing explanations behind (i) popovers linking to the docs site.

    **Removed**

    - **`/mnt/overlay/metrics-token`.** Nothing writes or reads it. An existing
      file is harmless and is simply ignored; the daemon will not recreate one.

??? note "v2.14.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - **bmcd v2.19.0 → v2.23.0**, four releases:

        - **A fan can be held at a step** (SQU-170). `opt=set&type=cooling` takes
          `mode=manual` to pause the zone's governor and `mode=auto` to hand the
          fan back. Until now a written step was returned to the governor's own
          choice within a poll, which is what made the interface's slider a
          control that lied. A held fan is taken back above the zone's hottest
          `active` trip, because this board declares no `critical` trip and
          nothing else would intervene.

        - **A flash targets the module that was asked for** (SQU-105). All four
          modules sit behind one hub on a v2.5 board, and the daemon used to take
          whichever answered first — a flash of node 2 could write node 1 and
          report success. The node-to-port mapping is read from this board's own
          device tree rather than assumed.

        - **An audit line per mutating call** (SQU-108), naming the action, node,
          caller, address and outcome, and naming the loopback bypass explicitly
          when there was no credential at all. Sent to the system log as well as
          the rotating file, because `/tmp` and `/var/log` are both tmpfs here.

        - **`bmcd_process_threads`**, the companion to the resident-set metric.

    - **`tpi` v1.2.2 → v1.3.0**: `cooling set --hold` and `--auto`, and a Governor
      column that says `-` rather than `running` on a daemon that does not report
      it.

    - **BMC-UI v3.14.0 → v3.15.0**: the fan slider now sits behind an explicit
      Override switch, offered only where the daemon reports it can actually hold
      a step.

    **Added**

    - **`/etc/default/syslogd`**, carrying the remote-logging knob documented and
      deliberately unset (SQU-108). `syslogd -R <host>:<port>` sends this board's
      kernel and daemon logs somewhere that survives a reboot; `/var/log` is a
      tmpfs and the overlay is the wrong answer, on a NAND with five free
      eraseblocks and a workload guaranteed to grow. A default pointing at a host
      nobody configured would make every boot wait on a DNS lookup.

??? note "v2.13.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - BMC-UI **v3.10.1 → v3.14.0**, four releases of interface work:

      - The console replays the module's scrollback when you open it, instead of
        showing a blank terminal however long the module has been running, and
        gains a **Redraw** button.
      - The reboot dialogs stop claiming the compute modules lose power. They do
        not, and this fork's not cutting them is one of the things it exists for.
        Both live places said otherwise, in all six languages.
      - Rebooting from Settings now says when a firmware is staged, so a reboot for
        an unrelated reason no longer silently applies an update.
      - An upload no longer offers a reboot that would do nothing. It parks the
        image on the SD card, and the message says so.
      - **Install OS** is red, like every other consequential action, and the
        shared confirmation dialog commits in red rather than in the colour of
        Save.
      - The firmware sources editor no longer breaks at 390 px.

    **Fixed**

    - **mDNS was eating the board** (SQU-175). This is the cause of both outages on
      2026-09-09, and it was ours.

      `mdnsd` binds every interface it can see. On this board that means the DSA
      switch ports — `node1`..`node4`, `ge0`, `dsa` — which share one MAC and one
      link-local address, because they are ports of a single switch rather than
      separate hosts. mdnsd announced on each, saw its own announcement arrive on
      the others, and called that a name conflict. Every conflict triggers a config
      reload, and mdnsd 0.12 leaks on reload.

      Measured on the board: **825 reloads in twelve seconds**, and the process
      growing **956 kB a minute** on a machine with 118 MB of RAM and no swap. That
      is ninety minutes from boot to a board that answers ping and nothing else.
      The same storm wrote those 825 log lines into `/var/log`, which is on the
      58 MB tmpfs, so it was consuming memory from both ends.

      `/etc/default/mdnsd` now binds it to `br0`, the only interface with an
      address and the one the default route uses. After the change, on the same
      board: **zero reloads in ninety seconds, and 8 kB of growth.**

    **Added**

    - **`mdnsd-guard`**, run every five minutes from cron. Restarts mdnsd if its
      resident set passes 20 MB, and logs the size that triggered it.

      A net under the fix above, not a substitute for it. The leak is upstream's
      and still present; only its trigger has been removed. On a board with no
      watchdog, where the failure mode is losing the machine entirely, a threshold
      check that does nothing on a healthy system is cheap insurance — and if it
      ever fires, the log line is the field evidence that something still reloads.

??? note "v2.12.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Fixed**

    - **A serial console could reboot the board by accident.** The kernel boots
      with `console=ttyS0` and a BREAK on that line triggers SysRq, with the next
      byte taken as the command. USB-serial adapters assert BREAK whenever a port
      is opened, closed or reconfigured, and nothing guarded it. The kernel's own
      help for `MAGIC_SYSRQ_SERIAL` describes the hazard exactly: *"a disconnected
      TTL level serial which can generate some garbage that can lead to spurious
      false sysrq detects."*

      The first instinct was to mask the dangerous commands off. That was the wrong
      trade: this board has **no watchdog**, so a serial reset is the only remedy
      short of walking to the rack, and it is worth keeping.

      So the trigger is guarded rather than the commands removed.
      `MAGIC_SYSRQ_SERIAL_SEQUENCE="sysrq"` means a BREAK on its own now does
      nothing; the sequence must follow it before any command is accepted. Garbage
      cannot produce that and a person typing it means it. The full command set
      stays available:

          BREAK, then "sysrq", then the key
            b  reboot        o  power off      s  sync
            w  blocked tasks m  memory         t  all tasks

      `S00sysrq` sets the runtime value to match, so the intent is visible in the
      init scripts and not only in a kernel config.

??? note "v2.11.0 — 9 September 2026"

    Built but **not installed**: the board wedged before this could be flashed and
    needs a physical power cycle first (SQU-172). This is the image to install when
    it comes back.

    **Changed**

    - bmcd **2.19.0**: the health gate's history as a metric
      (`bmcd_firmware_promotion_total`), the daemon's own resident set
      (`bmcd_process_resident_bytes`), a `refreshing` flag that can no longer stick
      through a panic, and a rollback slot whose version can finally be named.
    - BMC-UI **3.10.1**: a red warning on v2.5 boards that flashing may not target
      the module you chose, a bounded poll on the firmware page, and Reset network
      made destructive with a confirmation that says what it costs.
    - `tpi` **1.2.2**: `firmware install` works — it had never worked in any
      release — and `firmware list --refresh` waits for the daemon's re-poll.

    **Added**

    - The gate records what a promoted image replaced, so a rollback can be named
      rather than reported as "version not readable".

??? note "v2.10.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - bmcd **2.16.0**: every API operation has a path of its own —
      `GET /api/bmc/thermal`, `POST /api/bmc/hostname` — over the same dispatcher
      as the `?opt=&type=` form, which stays as it is; refusals on the new paths
      are RFC 9457 problem documents; and the daemon describes itself at
      `/api/bmc/openapi.json` (OpenAPI 3.1, response bodies not yet typed).
    - `tpi` **1.2.2**: `firmware install` works — it had never worked in any
      release — and `firmware list --refresh` waits for the daemon's re-poll
      instead of printing the previous list.

??? note "v2.9.2 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - BMC-UI **3.9.2**: each firmware source lists its newest three versions,
      always, with the rest behind "show N more". The previous rule showed only
      versions at or above the running one, which left an empty card the moment
      the board ran something no source had published yet.

??? note "v2.9.1 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - `tpi` **1.2.1** and BMC-UI **3.9.1**. The CLI in v2.9.0 was the one whose
      every fork command failed against a real board — the first release of the
      tool ever run against one found five bugs, all fixed here. The interface's
      USB selector no longer prints its label through its value, and every

??? note "v2.9.0 — 9 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - bmcd **2.15.1**, `tpi` **1.2.0**, BMC-UI **3.9.0**. Between them this release
      carries: a firmware catalogue that answers from cache and refreshes behind
      itself instead of blocking the page for sixteen seconds; park mode, so an
      uploaded image lands on the SD card and installing stays a separate choice;
      the hostname and the time servers as settings; configuration export and
      import before board B; the thermal zone's trip points, so the fan's step has
      a reason attached; a seven-tab interface reorganised around what a person is
      doing; and a command line that reaches all of it.

    **Added**

    - **Contract tests for the promotion gate** (`tests/gate.sh`). The gate decides
      whether a freshly booted image is kept or rejected, and nothing checked it: a
      change that promoted everything would have been found by a flash, or not at
      all. The harness sources `S99postupdate`, points its paths at scratch files,
      stubs `curl`, and asserts both the verdict and the reason for twelve cases —
      four of which must be **rejections**. It runs under `dash` and under
      `busybox ash`, the board's own shell.
    - A `checks` workflow that runs those tests and `shellcheck` on every push, in
      under a minute, separately from the two-hour image build. It also **mutates
      the gate twice and requires the suite to catch both**: a suite that stays
      green when a rejection is removed is decorative.

    **Changed**

    - **A release candidate no longer outranks its own release** (SQU-169).
      `is_newer` in `tpi-selfupdate` used GNU `sort -V` alone, which puts
      `v2.8.1-rc1` *after* `v2.8.1` — so a board on the finished release was
      offered its own candidate as an upgrade, and `--check` would have exited 10
      for ever. It now compares the numeric part first and only then the suffix,
      where carrying one loses to carrying none. `v2.2.0-unstable-hive.12` is
      likewise work towards v2.2.0 rather than after it.
    - `tests/version.sh` covers that ordering — eighteen cases including the tenth
      minor release, which a lexical compare gets wrong — and CI mutates the
      function back to the old behaviour and requires the suite to notice.
    - `tpi-selfupdate` can be sourced with `TPI_SELFUPDATE_LIB=1` to get its
      functions without running the update. That is what makes the above testable
      without a network or a board.
    - `S99postupdate` takes the path to `curl` from `CURL_BIN` rather than a
      literal, so the harness can exercise the `-x` check and the argument handling
      instead of bypassing them.

??? note "v2.8.1 — 9 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - **`turingpi.local` resolves again** (SQU-162). Dropping avahi for rootfs
      headroom (SQU-110) also removed the board's mDNS advertisement, and nothing
      replaced it — so `tpi` with no `--host` has failed since v2.3.0, because its
      default host is literally `turingpi.local`, and upstream's documentation
      tells people to reach the board that way. Nobody noticed here because this
      estate always passes an address.

      `mdnsd` replaces avahi: BSD-3, about 40 KB, and no D-Bus, expat or libdaemon
      behind it — which is what made avahi expensive, not avahi itself. The board
      advertises its own hostname, so a default image is `turingpi.local` again and
      a renamed board is whatever it was renamed to.
    - The web interface is advertised as `_https._tcp` on 443, so a Bonjour browser
      finds the board. Port 443 rather than the port-80 redirect: advertising the
      redirect costs a client two round trips to reach a page that was always going
      to be served over TLS.
    - **The promotion gate checks that the image is the one that was staged, and
      that it serves metrics** (SQU-140). The two existing checks prove the image
      is *alive* — the daemon answers, the switch ports exist — and neither proves
      it is *correct*: a build whose `/metrics` was completely broken would have
      been promoted. `release_matches()` now also requires that `/etc/os-release`
      agrees with the version named in the staged note, and that `/metrics`
      answers with `bmcd_build_info`.

      Verified on hardware: a note tampered to `v0.0.1` rolled the board back to
      v2.8.0 in about 35 seconds with the disagreement in `postupdate.log` — the
      first rollback this firmware has ever performed — and the same image,
      installed untampered, promoted. Every compute module's uptime continued
      uninterrupted through both reboots.

      Two details the board taught this change. `/metrics` has **no loopback
      exception** — only `/api/bmc` does — so the gate asks the daemon for a token
      via `type=metrics_token`, which mints one if none exists; reading the overlay
      file instead would have rolled back every good image on a fresh board. And a
      staged note that names a file but no version now says so, rather than
      claiming there was no note at all.

    **Changed**

    - bmcd **2.10.1** and `tpi` **1.1.1**. Between them: a parked image is ordered
      against the running version instead of showing as `unknown`, and
      `tpi firmware install` can actually install one — 1.1.0 posted it to an
      endpoint the daemon refuses for local sources, so the resolution succeeded
      and the install failed with a 400.

??? note "v2.8.0 — 8 September 2026"

    **Changed**

    - First release built entirely in `excavador-turing`. Firmware sources point at
      this fork; `tpi-selfupdate` follows.
    - bmcd 2.10.0, `tpi` 1.1.0, BMC-UI 3.7.0.

??? note "v2.7.0 — 8 September 2026"

    **Added**

    - Re-cut of the fork's work under the new organisation, carrying the versions
      the board was already running so that no board-visible version goes
      backwards.

    **Changed**

    - Kernel 6.12.109 LTS (upstream: 6.8, never a longterm release).
    - Buildroot 2025.02.17 LTS (upstream: 2024.05.1, end of life).
    - Health-gated A/B promotion: a new image boots tentatively and is kept only
      if the daemon answers and every compute module's switch port is present.
      Otherwise the board reboots onto the image it had.
    - A firmware update no longer power-cycles the compute modules.
    - The board temperature is exposed through `thermal_zone0`, and the kernel
      drives the fan from it instead of a fixed persisted speed.
    - `SHA256SUMS` published per release and verified on download.
